A Web App for storing the links on your laptop. But the backend and server are still in developing. The project only can run on the local browser. 


How to run

1. For Mac & Linux: 
    


    cd project
    
    npm start

2. For Windows: 


    
    cd project 
    
    npm run start 

Then you will run a react app on your computer browser.
